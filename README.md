# Stardust
Theme inspired by GOG Galaxy 2.0 for [Playnite](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite) Desktop Mode.

Playnite forum thread: https://playnite.link/forum/thread-468.html

## Theme goals
- Use GOG Galaxy 2.0 UI as inspiration to create a polished Playnite UI. The font used by it can be downloaded from [from here](https://www.1001freefonts.com/es/lato.font) to be used in Playnite. The font used by Playnite can be configured in `Settings` -> `Appearance` -> `Application font`
- Achieve a more modern and clean design with the chosen pallete and things like rounded corners in certain elements like the windows, borders, buttons and controls.
- Improve the user experience with small animations in certain parts.
- Change the aesthetic without affecting functionality.
- Polish certain parts of the UI to give a better user experience.
- Different aesthetic of other available themes available by default in Playnite and created by the community.
- Achieve features that are not available by default on Playnite via community extensions
